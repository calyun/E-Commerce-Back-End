`npm init`

`npm install mysql2`

## Usage

Create your sequelize database by typing `mysql -u root -p` followed by your password.  Once in mysql, type `source db/schema.sql`, then `quit`. Now that youre back in the normal terminal you can type `npm run seed` to seed the new database with your data.  Finally, type `npm start`.  Now that everything is setup you can test routes in Insomnia.
